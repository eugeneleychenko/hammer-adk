SALES CALL TRANSCRIPT - DISCOVERY CALL
Date: March 15, 2024
Participants: Sarah (Sales Rep), Mike (Prospect - IT Director)
Company: TechCorp Solutions
Duration: 32 minutes

SARAH: Hi Mike, thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I know you're busy, so I really appreciate you carving out 30 minutes.

MIKE: No problem, Sarah. I'm interested to learn more about your CRM solution.

SARAH: Great! Before I dive into our platform, I'd love to understand your current situation better. Can you tell me about your biggest challenges with customer management right now?

MIKE: Well, we're growing pretty rapidly. We went from 50 customers last year to about 200 now, and frankly, we're struggling to keep track of everything. We're still using spreadsheets and it's becoming a nightmare.

SARAH: That sounds frustrating. When you say "keep track of everything," what specific areas are causing the most pain?

MIKE: Customer communication history is scattered across different team members' emails. We lose track of where prospects are in our sales process. And don't get me started on trying to forecast revenue - it's basically impossible right now.

SARAH: I can definitely see how that would create problems. How many people are involved in your sales process currently?

MIKE: We have 5 salespeople and 2 account managers. Plus myself overseeing everything.

SARAH: And what's the impact of these tracking issues on your business? Are you losing deals because of it?

MIKE: I suspect we are. Last month, one of our biggest prospects said they felt ignored because two different salespeople contacted them about the same thing within a week. That was embarrassing.

SARAH: Ouch, that's exactly the kind of thing a good CRM prevents. What's your timeline for solving this problem?

MIKE: Well, my boss is asking for a solution by the end of Q2. He's getting frustrated with our inability to provide accurate sales reports.

SARAH: That gives us about 10 weeks. What happens if you don't solve this by then?

MIKE: Honestly? I think they'll bring in someone else to handle sales operations. The CEO is pretty results-oriented.

SARAH: I understand the pressure you're under. What's your budget range for a solution like this?

MIKE: We haven't set a firm number, but I'd say somewhere in the $10,000-$25,000 range annually would be reasonable.

SARAH: That's helpful. One more question - who else would be involved in this decision besides yourself?

MIKE: My boss, the VP of Sales, would need to approve anything over $15,000. And obviously the sales team would need to be on board since they'll be using it daily.

SARAH: Based on what you've shared, it sounds like our CRM could really help. We specialize in companies exactly your size that are experiencing rapid growth. Would you like me to show you how we've helped similar companies organize their sales process?

MIKE: Yes, that would be great. But I should mention - we tried a CRM two years ago and it was a disaster. The team hated it and we ended up going back to spreadsheets.

SARAH: That's actually pretty common. What specifically went wrong with that implementation?

MIKE: It was way too complicated. The interface was confusing, and it took forever to enter information. The team felt like it was slowing them down rather than helping.

SARAH: I completely understand. User adoption is critical. Our platform is designed with simplicity in mind - most users are productive within their first day. Would you be open to seeing a demo next week?

MIKE: Sure, that sounds good. What would you need from me?

SARAH: I'd like to invite a couple of your salespeople to join us so they can see how intuitive it is. Could you bring two of them to a 45-minute demo?

MIKE: I think I could make that work. Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon would be best.

SARAH: Perfect. I'll send you some calendar options. Mike, I'm confident we can solve these tracking issues and help you hit that Q2 deadline. Sound good?

MIKE: Yes, let's do it. Looking forward to the demo.

SARAH: Excellent. I'll follow up with the calendar invite and some prep materials. Thanks again for your time today!

MIKE: Thank you, Sarah. Talk to you soon.
